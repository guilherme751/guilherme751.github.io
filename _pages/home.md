I'm Guilherme S. G. Brotto, and I'm excited to share my journey in computer science with you. Here, you'll find insights into my projects, research, and interests in technology. You can also check my blog for some cool posts! Feel free to explore and connect!

I am an undergraduate computer science student at the Federal University of Espírito Santo, Brazil, where I actively participate in a scientific initiation project at the Laboratório de Pesquisa em Redes e Multimídia (LPRM). My passion for technology drives me to explore various domains, with a strong focus on machine learning and deep learning. I enjoy working on research projects that push the boundaries of artificial intelligence and data-driven solutions.

Beyond AI, I have experience in data science, mobile and web development, computer graphics, and algorithms. My curiosity leads me to continuously learn and experiment with new technologies, always seeking innovative ways to solve complex problems. Whether it's building intelligent models, developing applications, or optimizing algorithms, I am always eager to take on new challenges and grow as a developer and researcher.
